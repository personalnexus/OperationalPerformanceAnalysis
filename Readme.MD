Operational Performance Analysis (_opa_ for short) is a tool to read operational performance data from various types of log files and analyze and/or visualize it using Pandas.

I do not know whether there are already solutions out there doing this. There probably are. This is mostly a proof-of-concept side-project for me to dive deeper into Python in general and NumPy, Pandas etc. in particular.
